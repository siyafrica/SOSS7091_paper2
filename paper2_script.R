## Introduction - Why am I analysizing the difference in perceptions of the fourth estate holding government accountable according to age?
## I believe that younger citizens are less prone to seeing the media as having to hold govenment to account compared to older citizens


## Concepts and measurement
## Question 1 - The dataset: Afrobarometer open data on Africa. The survey used was the sixth round done in 2016.
## question 36 of the survey asks the respondents about their view on news media reporting on government mistakes and corruption
## the responses are split into 2 statements (statement 1 for media reporting and statement 2 saying that too much reporting will harm the country)
## respondents can then either agree with statement 1 or statement 2 with different levels of agreement, remain neutral or refuse to answer the question

# look at what countries are available
table(ab6$country)

## code to view country codes
attributes(ab6$country)

## Convert country codes into factor
ab6$country.f <- as_factor(ab6$country)

## to use labels 
table(ab6$country.f)

## Convert age column into a factor
attributes(ab6$age_cond)
ab6$age_cond.f <- as_factor(ab6$age_cond)
table(ab6$age_cond.f)

## View distribution of ages in a histrogram
ggplot(data = ab6) +
  aes(x = age_cond.f) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count") + 
  labs(x = "Age Groups", y = "No. of people")

## Convert Q36 responses on media perception in holding government to account into facors
attributes(ab6$q36)
ab6$q36.f <- as_factor(ab6$q36)
table(ab6$q36.f)

## View the distribution of responses in a histogram
ggplot(data = ab6) +
  aes(x = q36.f) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(x = "Responses", y = "No. of people") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=0, face = "italic", size=5))


## Recoding the data

## Recoding the grouping variable (age) into a dichotomy 
## Initially the age brackets were: 1 - 18-25, 2 - 26-35, 3 - 36-45, 4 - 46-55, 5 - 56-65, 6 - Over 65, 9 - Don't know
## After recoding the age variable will be: 1 - 18-45, 2 - 45 and older, 3 - Don't know

levels(ab6$age_cond.f) <- list("18 - 35" = c("18-25","26-35"), 
                        "36 - 55" = c("36-45","46-55"), 
                        "over 56" = c("56-65","Over 65"),
                        "don\'t know" = "Don\'t know")

table(ab6$age_cond.f)

## View the distribution of the grouping variable after the recoding
ggplot(data = ab6) +
  aes(x = age_cond.f) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  labs(x = "Age Groups", y = "No. of people")


## Recoding the outcome variable (perceptions on the media and government - Question 36 in the survey)
## Initially the levels in the question were: -1(Missing), 1(Agree very strongly with 1), 2(Agree with 1), 3(Agree with 2), 4(Agree very strongly with 2), 5(Agree with neithe), 9(Donâ€™t know), 98(Refused) 
## After recoding the levels for question 36 will be: 1(agree strong), 2(agree), 3(disagree - with statement 1), 4(disagree strongly - with statement 1), 5(neutral), 6(no response)

levels(ab6$q36.f) <- list("agree strongly" = "Agree very strongly with 1",
                         "agree" = "Agree with 1",
                         "disagree" = "Agree with 2",
                         "disagree strongly" = "Agree very strongly with 2",
                         "neutral" = c("Agree with neither", "Don\'t know"),
                         "no response" = c("Missing", "Refused"))

table(ab6$q36.f)

## View the distribution of q36 responses after the recoding
ggplot(data = ab6) +
  aes(x = q36.f) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(x = "Responses", y = "No. of people") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=0, face = "italic", size=5))

## Create an object with the data for South Africa
rsa <- subset(ab6, country.f == "South Africa")
